Bike Rental Project Overview

The Bike Rental project in Python is designed to manage the rental and inventory of bicycles, 
offering a user-friendly interface and insightful data handling through various Python functionalities.

1. Rental Management:
   
  The project utilizes lists and dictionaries to manage the rental process efficiently. 
  A list stores details of available bikes, including their unique IDs, types 
  (mountain, road, hybrid), and hourly rental rates. Each bike's status (rented or available) 
  is tracked using a dictionary where the bike ID serves as the key and the value indicates its current availabilitystatus.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Bike Rental project demonstrates the effective use of Python's data structures 
(lists, dictionaries) and functions to manage rental operations efficiently. By providing a seamless user experience, 
handling data dynamically, and offering insightful analytics, the project serves as a practical example of applying Python 
programming for real-world applications in rental management.
